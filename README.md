# SOHO-Network-Design
The primary aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient network infrastructure of a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network. This involves the creation of segmented VLANs to manage traffic effectively, configuring routers to enable inter-VLAN communication and integrating DHCP services for automatically IP address allocation.
