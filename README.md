# SOHO-Network-Design
The primary aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient network infrastructure of a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network. This involves the creation of segmented VLANs to manage traffic effectively, configuring routers to enable inter-VLAN communication and integrating DHCP services for automatically IP address allocation.

Network Technology implemented
Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch
Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling
Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers
Subnetting and IP Addressing
Configuring Inter-VLAN  Routing (Router on a stick)
Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server)
Configuring WLAN or wireless network (Access Point)
Configuring Host devices including laptops, smartphones
Testing and Verifying Network
