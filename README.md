# SOHO-Network-Design
The primary aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient network infrastructure of a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network. This involves the creation of segmented VLANs to manage traffic effectively, configuring routers to enable inter-VLAN communication and integrating DHCP services for automatically IP address allocation.
Network Technology implemented
o	Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch
o	Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling
o	Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers
o	Subnetting and IP Addressing
o	Configuring Inter-VLAN  Routing (Router on a stick)
o	Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server)
o	Configuring WLAN or wireless network (Access Point)
o	Configuring Host devices including laptops, smartphones
o	Testing and Verifying Network
